# Hi, I'm Joep Meindertsma!

- I'm working on a specification + implementation for modeling and exchanging data called [Atomic Data](https://docs.atomicdata.dev). The main implementation is [AtomicServer](https://github.com/atomicdata-dev/atomic-server): an open source, powerful, fast, lightweight CMS with features similar to Notion. Check it out at [atomicdata.dev](https://atomicdata.dev/)! I'm also maintaining a bunch of libraries and tools for Atomic: [js / npm library](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@tomic/lib), [React](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@tomic/react), [Svelte](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@tomic/svelte), a [CLI](https://crates.io/crates/atomic-cli/0.13.0) and a [Rust crate](https://docs.rs/atomic_lib/latest/atomic_lib/).
- I'm the CEO of [Ontola.io](https://ontola.io), a software development firm from the Netherlands that aims to give people more control over their data. I write things about the linked data web on [our blog](https://ontola.io/blog).
- I founded [PauseAI](https://pauseai.info) and actively lobby for slowing down AI development. I'm maintaining the website, social media channels and work with a commmunity of volunteers.
- I co-founded the open source e-democracy platform [Argu](https://argu.co), which aimed to get people involved in decision making. We helped governments reach their citizens by providing an easy to use environment where people can share their ideas, discuss, vote on issues and make decisions together. The Argu [source code is on gitlab](https://gitlab.com/ontola/argu/), but is no longer maintained. We've created [OpenBesluitvorming.nl](openbesluitvorming.nl/) (Dutch), a search engine for governmental meeting documents. Over 220 Dutch governments (municipalities, provinces) have joined so far. 

## Things I'm interested in

- Interoperability, standardizing data exchange, and tech that gives people more data ownership (like [Atomic Data](https://atomicdata.dev/) and [Solid](https://solidproject.org/))
- AI & AI safety
- Rust, WASM, plug-in systems
- Front-end development (React, Sveltekit)
- CMS development (working on [Atomic-Server](https://github.com/atomicdata-dev/atomic-server))
- E-democracy, using online tools to help groups of people make better decisions
- Music production, synthesizers, 3d modelling
