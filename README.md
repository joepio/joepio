# Hi, I'm Joep Meindertsma!

- I'm working on a specification + implementation for modeling and exchanging data called [Atomic Data](https://docs.atomicdata.dev). The main implementation is [AtomicServer](https://github.com/atomicdata-dev/atomic-server): an open source, powerful, fast, lightweight CMS with features similar to Notion. Check it out at [atomicdata.dev](https://atomicdata.dev/)! I'm also maintaining a bunch of libraries and tools for Atomic: [js / npm library](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@tomic/lib), [React](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@tomic/react), [Svelte](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@tomic/svelte), a [CLI](https://crates.io/crates/atomic-cli/0.13.0) and a [Rust crate](https://docs.rs/atomic_lib/latest/atomic_lib/).
- I'm the CEO of [Ontola.io](https://ontola.io), a software development firm from the Netherlands that focuses on Linked Data and giving people control over their data. I write things about the linked data web on [our blog](https://ontola.io/blog).
- I'm maintaining the [PauseAI](https://pauseai.info) website and lobby for slowing down AI development. This tech can kill every person on earth if we don't properly regulate AI safety.
- I co-founded the open source e-democracy platform [Argu](https://argu.co), which aims to get people involved in decision making. We help governments reach their citizens by providing an easy to use environment where people can share their ideas, discuss, vote on issues and make decisions together. We've created [OpenBesluitvorming.nl](openbesluitvorming.nl/) (Dutch), a search engine for governmental meeting documents. Over 220 Dutch governments (municipalities, provinces) have joined so far. The [source code is on gitlab](https://gitlab.com/ontola/argu/).


## Things I'm interested in

- Interoperability, standardizing data exchange
- Tech aiming to bring control of data back to the people (like [Atomic Data](https://atomicdata.dev/) and [Solid](https://solidproject.org/))
- E-democracy, using online tools to help groups of people make better decisions
- Music production, synthesizers, 3d modelling
- Rust, WASM, plug-in systems
