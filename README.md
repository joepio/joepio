### Hi, I'm Joep Meindertsma!

I'm the CEO of [Ontola.io](https://ontola.io), a tech start-up from the Netherlands that focuses on Linked Data and decentralizing the web. 

- We've built an e-democracy platform called [Argu](https://argu.co), which aims to get people involved in decision making. We help governments reach their citizens by providing an easy to use environment where people can share their ideas, discuss, vote on issues and make decisions together.
- Together with various organisations, we've created [OpenBesluitvorming.nl](openbesluitvorming.nl/) (Dutch), a search engine for governmental meeting documents. Over 140+ Dutch governments have joined so far. It extracts meeting data from various sources, standardizes it makes it available as linked open data. Although we have some cool apps who are using the data, we're primarily interested in using the data in Argu, so we can create the missing link between online citizen engagement and formal decision making.
- With [Dexes](https://dexes.nl), three organizations have teamed up to build an open data marketplace - powered by linked data.
- We're working on Solid, which is a standard for decentralizing the web using linked data. We're developing an (soon to be open source) Solid Pod
- I'm working on a specification for modeling and exchanging data called [Atomic Data](https://docs.atomicdata.dev).
