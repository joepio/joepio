# Hi, I'm Joep Meindertsma!

- In my spare time, I'm working on a specification for modeling and exchanging data called [Atomic Data](https://docs.atomicdata.dev). I'm also working on a Rust implementation [(cli, server, library)](https://github.com/joepio/atomic) and a Typescript implementation [(react browser app + library)](https://github.com/joepio/atomic-data-browser). Check out the demo at [atomicdata.dev](https://atomicdata.dev/)!
- I co-founded [Ontola.io](https://ontola.io), a tech start-up from the Netherlands that focuses on Linked Data and decentralizing the web. I write things about the linked data web on [our blog](https://ontola.io/blog).
- I'm the CEO of an e-democracy platform called [Argu](https://argu.co), which aims to get people involved in decision making. We help governments reach their citizens by providing an easy to use environment where people can share their ideas, discuss, vote on issues and make decisions together. We've created [OpenBesluitvorming.nl](openbesluitvorming.nl/) (Dutch), a search engine for governmental meeting documents. Over 220 Dutch governments (municipalities, provinces) have joined so far.
- I'm CTO of [Dexes](https://dexes.nl), a collaboration between three organizations to build an open data marketplace - powered by linked data and Solid.

## Articles I wrote

- Check out the [Ontola.io Blog](https://ontola.io/blog) for lots of articles on linked data

## Things I'm interested in

- Interoperability, standardizing data exchange
- Tech aiming to bring control of data back to the people (like [Atomic Data](https://atomicdata.dev/) and [Solid](https://solidproject.org/))
- E-democracy, using online tools to help organization make better decisions
- Music production, synthesizers, 3d modelling
